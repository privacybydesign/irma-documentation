Most of the core IRMA software is written in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language. For Go projects, API documentation is generated automatically from the source code by [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/):

* [`irmaserver`](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server/irmaserver)
* [`irma`](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago)
* [`irmaclient`](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/irmaclient)

When describing a JSON message on any of the other pages of this website, we will sometimes link to the corresponding Go struct on GoDoc.
