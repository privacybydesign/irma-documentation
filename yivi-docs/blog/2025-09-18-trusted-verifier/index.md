We are announcing the **release of the Trusted Verifier** on the 24th of September!

Trusted Verifiers marks a crucial step forward in our mission to enhance the security and reliability of digital identity verification within the Yivi ecosystem. It also secures the long term sustainability of the Yivi project.

## What is Trusted Verifier?
Trusted Verifier is a way for relying parties to be verified and trusted by Yivi. This means that verifiers that have been vetted and approved by Yivi will be able to request and receive verifiable credentials from users' Yivi wallets. Users of verifiers that are not trusted by Yivi will receive a warning in their Yivi app, informing them that the verifier is not trusted, and they need to be cautious when sharing their data.

## Why Trusted Verifier?
The introduction of Trusted Verifier is a significant milestone in our journey towards creating a secure and trustworthy digital identity ecosystem. By implementing this feature, we aim to:
1. **Enhance Security**: Ensure that users are correctly informed about the trustworthiness of the verifiers they interact with. Reducing the risk of fraud, unauthorized access and phishing attacks.
2. **Building a sustainable ecosystem**: By vetting and approving verifiers, we can create a more reliable and trustworthy ecosystem for digital identity verification, which is essential for the long-term success of the Yivi project.

Issueing verifiable credentials is a responsibility that we take seriously, it also comes with a cost. For instance issuing a mobile phone credential requires an SMS to be sent to the user, which has a cost. By implementing Trusted Verifier, we can ensure that the parties that are requesting and receiving verifiable credentials cover the costs associated with issuing these credentials. This will help us to sustain the Yivi project in the long term.

## Will Yivi stay free and open source?
Yes, Yivi will remain free and open source. The introduction of Trusted Verifier is not about monetizing the Yivi app or its core features, but rather about ensuring the sustainability of the project. By implementing Trusted Verifier, we can ensure that the costs associated with issuing verifiable credentials are covered by the parties that are requesting and receiving them, rather than by the users of the Yivi app.

Our commitment to open source and free access to digital identity solutions remains unwavering. We believe that everyone should have access to secure and reliable digital identity solutions, regardless of their financial situation.

We also offer sponsoring for organizations that want to use Yivi in a non-commercial way, but cannot cover the costs of being a Trusted Verifier. Please contact us for more information. Think about non-profits, open source projects, or educational institutions.
