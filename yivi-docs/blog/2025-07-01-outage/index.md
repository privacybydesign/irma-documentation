title: Service Interruption â€“ Yivi Keyshare Affected by Datacenter Issues

We are currently experiencing downtime due to ongoing issues at our cloud provider, Scaleway. This affects the availability of the Yivi keyshare database, which is required for certain authentication operations.

Unfortunately, this means that the Yivi app is currently unable to validate pincodes. We are closely monitoring the situation and working to restore services as soon as possible.

For real-time updates from our cloud provider, you can follow Scalewayâ€™s status page:

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience while we work through this.
