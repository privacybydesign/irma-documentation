Weâ€™re excited to introduce a new feature in Yivi: IBAN Issuance via verified iDEAL payments. This addition brings secure, self-sovereign proof of bank account ownership right into the hands of Yivi users.

## How it works
The IBAN issuer enables users to receive a verifiable credential containing their bank account information, simply by completing a â‚¬0.01 iDEAL transaction. This small payment serves as proof of account ownership.

After a successful payment, the following information is extracted and issued as an IBAN credential:
- Full name of the account holder
- IBAN
- BIC

This credential can then be used in any Yivi-enabled service that needs proof of bank account ownership, such as financial onboarding, gig-economy platforms, or trusted peer-to-peer transactions.

## Backed by CMâ€™s IBAN Verification
Yiviâ€™s IBAN issuer is powered by [CM.com's IBAN Verification service](https://knowledgecenter.cm.com/kc/what-is-iban-verification-and-how-does-it-work), a reliable and widely-used system for verifying account ownership via a â‚¬0.01 transfer. CM ensures that the account details are validated and returned in a privacy-respecting way, fitting seamlessly into Yiviâ€™s selective disclosure model.

## Try it now
The IBAN issuer is live and available at:
ðŸ‘‰ https://iban-issuer.yivi.app/en

Users can visit the page, initiate the iDEAL verification process and add an IBAN credential in just a few clicks.

## Why this matters
Verifying a bank account typically requires sharing large amounts of personal data or uploading sensitive documents. With this new IBAN issuer, Yivi brings a privacy-by-design, user-controlled alternative that fits modern digital interactions â€” no oversharing, no intermediaries, and cryptographically verifiable.

We're proud to keep extending Yiviâ€™s ecosystem with trusted, reusable digital credentials. Let us know what you think or how you'd like to integrate IBAN verification into your workflows!
