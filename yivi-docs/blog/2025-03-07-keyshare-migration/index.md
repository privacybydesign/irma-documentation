In the night of March 17th to 18th, 2025, at 01:00 CET, we will complete the final phase of the migration from SIDN to Caesar Groep. The last two components that require temporary downtime are the Keyshare Server and MyYivi. These systems play a crucial role in Yivi's authentication and identity management services, and we want to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption.

## Migration Plan
To ensure a seamless transition, we have prepared the following steps:

- Yivi App Update - March 11th, 2025
  - A Yivi App release will update the Keyshare Server endpoint from `https://irma.sidn.nl/tomcat/irma_keyshare_server` to `https://keyshare.yivi.app`.
  - The trust scheme will be changed to use the new Keyshare Server.
  - During this transition, https://keyshare.yivi.app will act as a reverse proxy to the existing SIDN Keyshare Server, ensuring uninterrupted service.
- Final Migration - March 18th, 2025
  - At 01:00 CET, the SIDN Keyshare Server will be shut down.
  - The Keyshare database will be migrated to our new infrastructure.
  - The reverse proxy at `https://keyshare.yivi.app` will be removed, and the new Keyshare Server will be brought online.
  - The DNS for `irma.sidn.nl` will be updated to redirect users who have not yet updated their app to the new environment.

## Expected Impact
There is no expected impact regarding the Yivi App update on the 11th of March.

There is approximately 1 hour of downtime  **expected downtime** for users in the night of the 17th-18th of March
Users will receive errors when entering the pin in Yivi.

## What can you do?
Organizations using Yivi should take the following steps to mitigate potential issues:
- Verify Integrations: Ensure all integrations with Yivi services continue to function correctly after the migration.
- Inform Users: Notify your users about the scheduled downtime to manage expectations and reduce support requests.
