The end of 2024 is in sight, and our team is working hard to deliver as much progress to the project as possible. As part of our responsibility to the community, we're happy to let you in about some of the improvements we have been working on. 


## Email Templates
In Yivi, user is the central focus, and that is about more than privacy. The look and feel of all interactions 
of the user with the Yivi ecosystem should be welcoming and user-friendly. 
That's why we have improved the templates user receive when adding their email address to their wallet, to have the Yivi look and feel.
