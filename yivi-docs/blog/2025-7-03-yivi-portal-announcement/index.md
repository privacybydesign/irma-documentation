<a href="https://portal.yivi.app"> Yivi Portal </a> is Yivi's new initiative to help with a smooth launch for the Trusted/Pretty verifier. Trusted Verifier is a pivotal part of the roadmap as mentioned earlier in earlier blog posts and
serves as part of our commitment to our users, as well as helps with transparency with our verifiers.
In this blog post I will dive into what is the portal exactly, and what can you expect from the coming updates.


## Yivi Portal 

As part our core values, we want to make Yivi more accessible and easy to use. That also concerns developers and the business facing side of matters. 
In the portal you can see which organizations play a part and work with Yivi, search between the credentials and personal information that are available. <br/>
 As a verifier (referred to as relying party to adhere with the most recently used terminologies) you can register as an organization. You will then be able to set up your relying party and wait to join Yivi as a trusted verifier.
Another feature now coppled with the portal is the new <a>attribute index</a> service you can see  
<a href="https://attribute-index.yivi.app/">here</a>. You can also issue demo credentials as you did previously. 




## Trusted Verifier 
:::warning
The Trusted Verifier will be set in motion September 1st

Trusted Verifier is more than anything, rooted in enhancing user privacy through UX. 
This program is also known as pretty verifier program has been in the works as a way to further help our 
users stay safe and make informed decisions regarding sharing their information with Yivi. Yivi makes it easy for 
any party to set up a verification service. Yivi already does this to some extent, with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/pbdf-requestors"> requestors scheme </a>.
Parties have already been able to make themselves known to Yivi, by adding their branding and hostname, which would then be manually verified by our team. The app would read this and present
user with the user friendly branding (name and logo). Otherwise users would be encountered with the raw url starting the session, which to most users 
will seem odd and unsafe. 
The new initiative plans to take this an step further, making it an easier and more instantanious decision for the user that what seems trusted party to share information
with and what is not. 
## What changes now?

Now with the portal up and running, we kindly ask relying parties that are interested in providing a good user experience
to their users to join by registering at the Yivi Portal, which makes participation easier than before. Want to start by joining to the portal? <a href=""> This page </a>in our Yivi documention goes through the steps on how to use the portal as a relying party. 
In the near future, we are adding support for issuers (attestation providers).
