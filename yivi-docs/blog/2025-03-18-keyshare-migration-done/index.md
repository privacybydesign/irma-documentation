We are pleased to announce the successful completion of the Yivi Keyshare Server migration. As of March 18, 2025, at 01:00 CET, all services have been seamlessly transitioned from SIDN to Caesar Groep.

## What This Means for You
- **Enhanced Performance**: The migration ensures improved reliability and efficiency in our authentication and identity management services.​
- **Updated Endpoints**: The Keyshare Server endpoint has been updated to https://keyshare.yivi.app. Please make sure to update the Yivi App. We maintain backwards compatibility. 

## Next Steps
- **Verify Integrations**: Confirm that all your systems and applications interacting with Yivi services are functioning correctly with the new endpoint.​
- **Inform Users**: If you manage a user base that relies on Yivi, please communicate this update to ensure a smooth user experience.​

We appreciate your cooperation during this transition and remain committed to providing secure and efficient digital identity solutions.
