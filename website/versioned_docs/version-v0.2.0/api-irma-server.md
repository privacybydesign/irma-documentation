```shell
irma server [options...]
```

The API that this server offers consists of two parts:

* Endpoints under `/irma`. This is used exclusively by the [irmaclient](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/tree/master/irmaclient)/[IRMA app](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_mobile), and is not documented here.
* Endpoints under `/session` with which IRMA session requestors can start IRMA sessions, monitor their status and retrieve their result afterwards.

## API reference

<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

For each of these endpoints, if the HTTP status code indicates that the request was not successful (i.e. not in the 2xx range), then the server returns an [`irma.RemoteError`](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago#RemoteError) instance. For example, attempting to [retrieve the session result](#get-session-token-result) of an unknown session returns
```json
{"status": 400, "error": "SESSION_UNKNOWN", "description": "Unknown or expired session"}
```
The following fields may occur in this message:
* `status`: HTTP error code associated to this error
* `error`: an error `Type` from the list of possible errors in the [server API documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#Error)
* `description`: English human-readable description of this error
* `message`: May contain additional information
* `stacktrace`: Stack trace of the error, only if verbose mode is enabled

---

### `POST /session`

Start an IRMA session. What to POST to this endpoint depends on the server configuration:

* If `no_auth` is true, an [(extended) JSON session request](session-requests.md)
* If `no_auth` is false:
  * [(extended) JSON session request](session-requests.md) with an API token in the `Authorization` HTTP header
  * [JWT session request](session-requests.md#jwts-signed-session-requests) signed with RS256 or HS256

If `no_auth` is false, then which of these options should be taken depends on the [`requestors`](irma-server.md#requestor-authentication) option passed to the `irma server`.

In each case an appropriate `Content-Type` with `text/plain` or `application/json` must be included.

If the request was successfully parsed, and authenticated if applicable, then the server returns a *session package*:
```json
{
  "token":"KzxuWKwL5KGLKr4uerws",
  "sessionPtr": {"u":"https://example.com/irma/ysDohpoySavbHAUDjmpz","irmaqr":"disclosing"}
}
```
In the endpoints below, the `{token}` placeholder must be replaced with the above session `token`. The `sessionPtr` points to the IRMA session for the IRMA app user, and should be displayed as a QR for the user to scan, or encoded in a universal link for a mobile session, e.g. using [`handleSesion()`](api-irmajs.md#handlesession) from `irmajs`.

Each session starts in the `"INITIALIZED"` [session status](#get-session-token-status). Regardless of how it reaches its ending status (`"DONE"`, `"CANCELLED"`, `"TIMEOUT"`), it is kept in memory for 5 minutes after reaching its ending status. After that all endpoints below requiring the session `token` return error `"SESSION_UNKNOWN"`.

---

### `DELETE /session/{token}`

Cancel the session: set the [session status](#get-session-token-status) to `"CANCELLED"`.

---

### `GET /session/{token}/status`

Retrieve the [session status](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#Status) as a JSON string. Returns one of:
* `"INITIALIZED"`: the session has been started and is waiting for the client
* `"CONNECTED"`: the client has retrieved the session request, we wait for its response
* `"CANCELLED"`: the session is cancelled: the user refused, or the user did not have the requested attributes, or an error occurred during the session
* `"DONE"`: the session has completed successfully
* `"TIMEOUT"`: session timed out

Of these the latter three are *ending statuses*; once the session reaches such a status, it will not switch status again. A session starts as `"INITIALIZED"` and reaches one of the ending statuses either directly or after becoming `"CONNECTED"`.

> The session is cancelled and receives status `"CANCELLED"` not only when the IRMA app user refuses, but also when the session is aborted due to an error.

> If the session is cancelled due to the user aborting, it is (by design) not possible using this or the other endpoints of the `irma server` to distinguish between (1) the user had the requested attributes but refused to disclose them, and (2) the session was aborted by the user's IRMA app because (s)he did not have the required attributes.

---

### `GET /session/{token}/statusevents`

Subscribe to a [server-sent event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) stream of status updates. Whenever the session status changes, an event is sent with the new session status as a JSON string. If you need to monitor the status of a session, this is preferred over polling to `GET /session/{token}/status`.

---

### `GET /session/{token}/result`

Get the [session result](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#SessionResult). Example output:
```json
{
  "type" : "disclosing",
  "status" : "DONE",
  "disclosed" : [{
    "status" : "PRESENT",
    "rawvalue" : "yes",
    "id" : "irma-demo.MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18",
    "value" : {
      "en" : "yes",
      "nl" : "yes",
      "" : "yes"
    }
  }],
  "proofStatus" : "VALID",
  "token" : "ELMExi5iauWYHzbH7gwU"
}
```
The response may contain the following fields:
* `token`: Session token
* `status`: Current [session status](#get-session-token-status)
* `type`: [Session type](what-is-irma.md#session-types): one of `"disclosing"`, `"signing"`, or `"issuing"`
* `proofStatus`: One of the package level [irma.ProofStatus](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago#pkg-constants) constants, indicating the cryptographic validity of the attributes and proofs of knowledge:
   * `"VALID"`: proofs are valid
   * `"INVALID"`: proofs are invalid
   * `"INVALID_TIMESTAMP"`: Attribute-based signature has invalid timestamp
   * `"UNMATCHED_REQUEST"`: proofs do not correspond to a specified request
   * `"MISSING_ATTRIBUTES"`: proofs do not contain all requested attributes
   * `"EXPIRED"`: Attributes were expired at creation time
* `disclosed`: List of [attributes disclosed](https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago#DisclosedAttribute) by the user
* `signature`: The full attribute-based signature in case of `"signing"` sessions
* `error`: Error message in case of failure

If the session is not yet finished (that is, the session status is `INITIALIZED` or `CONNECTED`), then only the first three fields are populated. (For getting just the current session status, using [`GET /session/{token}/statusevents`](http://localhost:3000/docs/api-irma-server#get-session-token-statusevents) or [`GET /session/{token}/status`](http://localhost:3000/docs/api-irma-server#get-session-token-status) is preferred.)

This endpoint just fetches the session result, and works normally even if the session failed. If so, the `status`, `proofStatus` or `error` fields will indicate what happened. Be sure to check these fields when retrieving and handling the session result.

### `GET /session/{token}/result-jwt`

If a JWT private key was [provided in the configuration of the `irma server`](irma-server.md#signed-jwt-session-results), then this returns a [JWT](https://jwt.io) signed by the `irma server` with the message from [`GET /session/{token}/result`](#get-session-token-result) above as JWT body, along with the following standard JWT fields:
* `iss`: name of the current `irma server` as defined in its configuration
* `iat`: Unix timestamp indicating when this JWT was created
* `sub`: `verification_result` or `signing_result` or `issuing_result`

This way, even if the session result from the `irma server` travels along an untrusted route (for example the user's browser), the session result can still be validated and trusted.

---

### `GET /session/{token}/getproof`

Also returns a session result JWT, but one whose structure is the same as the session JWTs returned by the [`irma_api_server`](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_api_server). Only works if a JWT private key was [provided in the configuration of the `irma server`](irma-server.md#signed-jwt-session-results).

---

### `GET /publickey`

If a JWT private key was [provided in the configuration of the `irma server`](irma-server.md#signed-jwt-session-results), then this returns the corresponding public key in PEM with which the server's session result JWTs returned by [`GET /session/{token}/result-jwt`](#get-session-token-result-jwt) and [`GET /session/{token}/getproof`](#get-session-token-getproof) can be verified.
